Situated north of Mindoro and north of Malaysia's Sabah Island, Palawan is the country's largest province spanning 1.5 million hectares. An ideal breeding ground for tropical flora and fauna, Palawan has more than a thousand islands and islets where monkeys, squirrels, bear cats, and zebras thrive with wild tropical plants and corals.

Palawan's population follows the same pattern. The province has attracted peoples of all backgrounds and it is said that today's Palawenos are a fusion of 81 different cultural groups. Foreigners, too, have grown to love this quiet province.

Palawan consists of about 1,769 islands; the Calamian Island group to the north, the Cuyo Islands group to the northwest, and the Balabac-Bugsuk group to the southwest.

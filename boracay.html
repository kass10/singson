<p align="center"> Boracay is a resort island in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines. It lies 0.8 kilometers (0.50 mi) off the northwest coast of Panay. Having a total area of 10.32 square kilometers (3.98 sq mi), it is under the jurisdiction of three barangays in Malay, Aklan, which in 2015, had a population of 32,267. The island was administered by the Boracay Inter-agency Task Force during its six-month-long closure in 2018.

Apart from its white sand beaches, Boracay is also famous for being one of the world's top destinations for relaxation. As of 2013, it was emerging among the top destinations for tranquility and nightlife.

Boracay was awarded as the 2012 Best Island in the World by the international travel magazine Travel + Leisure. In 2014, the resort island was at the top of the "Best Islands in the World" list published by the international magazine Cond√© Nast Traveler. In 2016, Boracay headed the magazine's list of "Top 10 destinations to watch".

In April 2018, the Philippine Government decreed a 6-month closure of the island for tourists to undertake major renovation works, especially of the sewage system, which had become obsolete and insufficient. It re-opened in October 2018, with a set of new rules meant to address a variety of issues. Boracay is paradise for certified sun-worshippers all over the world. In fact, local and foreign tourists have made Boracay their yearly destination. Others have chosen to live on this haven.

Boracay can be found on the northwestern tip of Panay in Aklan, a province on the Visayas island known for its colorful Ati-Atihan festival.

Boracay's thousand-hectares boast of all the elements of a tropical heaven - crystal blue waters, powder white sand, liberal doses of tropical palms and flowering plants, and a healthy and diverse marine life.

Boracay has three little communities - Yapak in the north, Manoc-Manoc in the south and Balabag in between. Hilly elevations of up to 100 meters above sea level characterize Yapak and Manoc-Manoc. Intertwining trails link the small villages and lead to lush tropical jungles.
